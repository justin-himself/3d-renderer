## Quick start 

The program only needs `numpy` and `matplotlib` to run, but the performance will be heavily limited.

To achieve best experience, install all the requirements by executing:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To render a spinning toilet, use 

```bash
python3 main.py models/toilet_1451.obj output
```

A window will pop up so you can adjust the object's positon. Press enter when you are satisfied and the render will start.

The result will be saved as `output.gif`
