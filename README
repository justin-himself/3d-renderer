## Optional 

In minimum configuration the project only depened on python >=3.9 standard librarys and numpy, but adding the following libraries / configurations will greatly enhance the performance.

### OpenCV (Strongly Recommended)

OpenCV gives way faster refresh rate than standard python console. Use the following command to install:

```bash
pip3 install python-opencv
```

### NumPy accelerated with Apple Silicon Hardware

```bash
conda create -n 3d_engine python=3.9 numpy "blas=*=*accelerate*"
conda config --set pip_interop_enabled true
conda activate 3d_engine
```

### CuPy (Optional)

On machines with a NVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA 3.0 or higher, CuPy can act as a substitute of NumPy and provide up to 10x the compute speed and greatly enhance the performance, compared to the default method which calculates using CPU only.

To install, follow the [installing instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html) by CuPy.
