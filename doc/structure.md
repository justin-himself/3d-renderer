Here's a breakdown of the structure:

- Engine: This directory contains subdirectories for different engine components like the rendering engine, physics engine, and sound engine. Each of these components can have their own classes and modules.

- Scene: This directory is responsible for managing the game scenes and the objects within them. There are subclasses for different types of objects, such as EntityObjects (with subclasses for different types of entities like enemies and players) and StationaryObjects (like skyboxes and buildings).

- InputOutputSystem: This section deals with managing user input, output to the screen, and other input/output-related functionality.

- UISystem: The UI system is divided into layers, screens, and UI elements. UI elements include things like dialog boxes and text objects.

- Serialization: This section handles the saving and loading of game objects and scenes from files.

- GameEngineApp: This is where your application's entry point, such as main.cpp, would reside. It's responsible for initializing the engine, creating scenes, and managing the game loop.

- ConfigurationFiles: Store configuration files that specify settings for the engine and the game.

- Resources: This is where you can place assets like textures, models, and sound files.
