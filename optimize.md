1. use clipping
2. use z-buffering

3. Can we reduce the number of polygons displayed when zoom out?
4. Normal is recalculated every time, can we apply changes to normal as well?

3. avoid doing repetition (sin(x) -> sx)
4. Use a profiler and identify the most important contributor to cumtime
5. Use parallel computation
